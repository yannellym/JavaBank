/**
 * In this project you will tie together many of the concepts that you have learned throughout the
 *         course into a unified banking application.  You will develop a program that performs many
 *         common bank transactions that a bank employee or customer might perform on one or more
 *         accounts.
 *         When executed, the program will display a menu with the following choices as follows:
 *         ============================================================
 *         What do you want to do?
 *         1. Open an account
 *         2. Get account information and balance
 *         3. Change PIN
 *         4. Deposit money in account
 *         5. Transfer money between accounts
 *         6. Withdraw money from account
 *         7. ATM withdrawal
 *         8. Deposit change
 *         9. Close an account
 *         10. Add monthly interest to all accounts
 *         11. End Program
